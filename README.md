1) I added a check function to cover basics. It does not include all corner cases. 2) Not necessarily. However, pyMongo is a lot more practical compared to other storage tools. 3) E-mail adress is a unique identifier. I would just insert -1 to indicate a non-existent value. 4) Several solutions : - I may discard street name, city etc as Zip code identifies them. 2) I may encode headers with their initials. 3) I may search through records and discard the ones that are inactive for a reasonable amount of time, i.e 10 years.
